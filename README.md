# NoteStudio 📝

NoteStudio is a lightweight, browser-based note-taking application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project focuses on clean structure, usability, and maintainable code without relying on external frameworks.

It is designed as both a functional productivity tool and a portfolio project demonstrating strong frontend fundamentals.

- DOM manipulation and event handling  
- Writing modular and reusable JavaScript code  
- Organizing a frontend project for long-term maintainability  
- Translating design concepts into functional user interfaces  
- Implementing dynamic content based on real-time data (greetings and date display)  
- Calculating and displaying relative timestamps for notes to improve usability and context
